# TwentyFour-Part-Two

24 is a math game, in which the player is presented with 4 numbers and they must determine a way to combine those numbers using mathematical operations to get 24 as the result. Each number must be used, and each number can be used only once.  

#Example.
As an example, if the user is presented with the card shown below: they may come up with the following solution (which may not be the only one!):
5 x 5 = 25 
4 – 3 = 1 
25 – 1 = 24

if the user is presented with the example above, they may type something like (5 * 5) - (4 - 3) for their
solution.
